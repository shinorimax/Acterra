# Residential Electrification Dashboard

This project is an interactive dashboard that helps California residents simulate the financial and environmental impacts of residential electrification. It compares electricity rate plans (PG&E and CCAs), estimates long-term savings from solar and EV adoption, and models carbon emissions reduction.

## Features

- Rate plan comparisons across PG&E and major CCAs
- Emissions and cost simulation for electrification scenarios
- Solar ROI modeling based on Project Sunroof data
- Plans to integrate EV and seasonal usage models
